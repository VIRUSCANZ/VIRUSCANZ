#### Based in UTDR + Phighting Area - Usually with friends! 

DNT if i don't know you, I don't have a TD or TT I just.. don't want strangers cuddling booping or hiding behind me! (im antisocial okay ToT)

Do not copy or take heavy inspo from my skins **WITHOUT** asking! 

I have audhd , severe anxiety , depression, and am a DID system of 30+ , Please respect that and do not ask for a specific person to front unless you are close. You can always ask who's fronting tho ^-^

Underlust + Leviathantale DNI. I do not like,, those weird.. ass fetish.. things... whatever they are... STAY AWAY!!

I tend to cuss a lot and can get hyper sometimes and make some jokes that people might not find as funny as I do + If i mkae you uncomfortable let me know! I most likely won't have realized

I only use tonetags if I deem the situtation needs it, I won't use them otherwise.
